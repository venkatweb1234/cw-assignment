# Storefront Single-Page App

### Question
Using appropriate frameworks as a foundation, create a single-page app which renders a mock storefront that matches the
provided screenshots, using the supplied JSON and media files. 
* The storefront consists of three main screens: a category list page, a product details page, and a cart page. More
  details are provided below.
* Clicking the Add to Cart button on a product tile or on the product detail page should add the item to the cart
  dynamically.
* Attempting to add a duplicate item to the cart should instead increment the quantity for that item.
* It should be possible to change quantities and remove items on the cart page.
* Cart totals should update appropriately.
* You are free to use whatever frameworks you deem appropriate, but you should justify your choice in the application's
  README.
* Your assignment will be judged on structure, clarity of code, reusability and extensibility, testability, etc.

### Sample Screens
#### Category List page:
![](./screens/category-page.png)
* Clicking the My Cart link should display the Cart Popup.
* Hovering over one of the product tiles should display an overlay prompting the user to Add to Cart or View Details,
  as below:

![](./screens/product-tile-overlay.png)

#### Cart Popup:
![](./screens/cart-popup.png)
* You should be able to remove items from the cart using the popup.
* The View Cart button should take you to the cart page.
* The Checkout button does not need to do anything.
* When the popup is displayed, clicking anywhere outside it on the page should dismiss the popup.

#### Product details page:
![](./screens/product-details.png)
* Clicking the My Cart link should display the Cart Popup.
* The quantity buttons should work as expected.
* Clicking Add to Cart should work as expected.

#### Cart page:
![](./screens/cart.png)
* Clicking the My Cart link should display the Cart Popup.
* The quantity buttons should work as expected, including updating the total for each line item and the cart total.
* The remove buttons should work as expected.
* The Continue Shopping link should return to the homepage.
* The Checkout button does not need to do anything.

### Candidate Notes
You should
* Submit your assignment as a Git repository hosted on either GitHub or BitBucket.
* Include a README explaining how to install dependencies and run your application.
* Include automatic tests and instructions for running them.
* Explain any compromises/shortcuts you made due to time considerations.
* We use Typescript
